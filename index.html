      The Mid-Pacific Research Laboratory
    </h1>
    <p>
      <a href="http://researchlaboratory.science">A researchlaboratory project</a>
    </p>
    <h2 id="physics-chemistry-engineering-biology-weve-got-it-all">
      Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Biology, we've got it all.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Mid-Pacific Research Laboratory is a general-purpose research laboratory for
      just about any subject, from Physics to Biology to Electrical Engineering to
      Astronomy to <em>(gasp)</em> Oceanography.
    </p>
    <h2 id="were-in-the-middle-of-the-pacific">
      We're in the middle of the Pacific.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There's nothing bothering you here. Every single building has an ocean view.
    </p>
    <h2 id="did-i-mention-autonomous">
      Did I mention autonomous?
    </h2>
    <p>
      There's almost no manual labor in this city. Everything is autonomous, including
      the Factory.
    </p>
    <h2 id="that-factory-what-is-it">
      That factory... what is it?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If there's something you need made, create a Factory Definition File (.FDF file and
      send it off to the autonomous factory. Within a day, whatever you had made will be
      sent directly to your room, at no cost.
    </p>
    <h2 id="self-sustaining-really">
      Self-sustaining. Really.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We have many eco-friendly mostly autonomous utility buildings that provide
      everything a research station in the middle of the ocean needs.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hydro-atomic power
      </li>
      <li>Desalination plant (Salt water to fresh water)
      </li>
      <li>Non-autonomous fishing building (with rod lending!)
      </li>
      <li>The Factory
      </li>
      <li>Farm (where machines tend to plants and people tend to animals)
      </li>
      <li>Autonomous mine
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="price">
      Price
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can get this all for the low, low price of <strong>$0</strong> . That's right.
      Every single perk of this research laboratory for free. Want to build an airplane
      (or something equally as large)? Free. Want to create a new species? Free. Want to
      create another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasteading" title=
      "Wikipedia">seasteading</a> research laboratory? We'll lend you our boats to help.
      Everything in this laboratory is free, and we have no expenses (as we are
      self-sustaining).

    <p>
      Okay, we'll admit: this isn't a thing. Yet. We are in need of funding to get this
      lab off the ground. There's not an IndieGoGo or Kickstarter, we're testing a new
      service made just for the MPRL: <code>researchlaboratory.science</code> . It's a
      website to help get new scientific research laboratories off the ground. The
      backend is being set up, but for now you can use one of our donation buttons:
