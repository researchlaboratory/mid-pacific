<a id="the-mid-pacific-research-laboratory" class="anchor" href="#the-mid-pacific-research-laboratory" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Mid-Pacific Research Laboratory</h1>

<p><a href="http://researchlaboratory.science">A researchlaboratory project</a></p>

<h2>
<a id="physics-chemistry-engineering-biology-weve-got-it-all" class="anchor" href="#physics-chemistry-engineering-biology-weve-got-it-all" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Biology, we've got it all.</h2>

<p>The Mid-Pacific Research Laboratory is a general-purpose research laboratory for just about any subject, from Physics to Biology to Electrical Engineering to Astronomy to <em>(gasp)</em> Oceanography.</p>

<h2>
<a id="were-in-the-middle-of-the-pacific" class="anchor" href="#were-in-the-middle-of-the-pacific" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>We're in the middle of the Pacific.</h2>

<p>There's nothing bothering you here. Every single building has an ocean view.</p>

<h2>
<a id="did-i-mention-autonomous" class="anchor" href="#did-i-mention-autonomous" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Did I mention autonomous?</h2>

<p>There's almost no manual labor in this city. Everything is autonomous, including the Factory.</p>

<h2>
<a id="that-factory-what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#that-factory-what-is-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>That factory... what is it?</h2>

<p>If there's something you need made, create a Factory Definition File (.FDF file and send it off to the autonomous factory. Within a day, whatever you had made will be sent directly to your room, at no cost.</p>

<h2>
<a id="self-sustaining-really" class="anchor" href="#self-sustaining-really" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Self-sustaining. Really.</h2>

<p>We have many eco-friendly mostly autonomous utility buildings that provide everything a research station in the middle of the ocean needs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hydro-atomic power</li>
<li>Desalination plant (Salt water to fresh water)</li>
<li>Non-autonomous fishing building (with rod lending!)</li>
<li>The Factory</li>
<li>Farm (where machines tend to plants and people tend to animals)</li>
<li>Autonomous mine</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="price" class="anchor" href="#price" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Price</h2>

<p>You can get this all for the low, low price of <strong>$0</strong>. That's right. Every single perk of this research laboratory for free. Want to build an airplane (or something equally as large)? Free. Want to create a new species? Free. Want to create another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasteading" title="Wikipedia">seasteading</a> research laboratory? We'll lend you our boats to help. Everything in this laboratory is free, and we have no expenses (as we are self-sustaining).</p>

<h1>
<a id="funding" class="anchor" href="#funding" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Funding</h1>

<p>Okay, we'll admit: this isn't a thing. Yet. We are in need of funding to get this lab off the ground. There's not an IndieGoGo or Kickstarter, we're just using good ole' cryptocurrencies and PayPal.</p>
