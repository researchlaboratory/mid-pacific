{"name":"Mid-Pacific Research Laboratory","tagline":"A planned self-sustaining floating research city.","body":"## Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Biology, we've got it all.\r\nThe Mid-Pacific Research Laboratory is a general-purpose research laboratory for just about any subject, from Physics to Biology to Electrical Engineering to Astronomy to *(gasp)* Oceanography.\r\n## We're in the middle of the Pacific.\r\nThere's nothing bothering you here. Every single building has an ocean view.\r\n## Did I mention autonomous?\r\nThere's almost no manual labor in this city. Everything is autonomous, including the Factory.\r\n## That factory... what is it?\r\nIf there's something you need made, create a Factory Definition File (.FDF file and send it off to the autonomous factory. Within a day, whatever you had made will be sent directly to your room, at no cost.\r\n## Self-sustaining. Really.\r\nWe have many eco-friendly mostly autonomous utility buildings that provide everything a research station in the middle of the ocean needs.\r\n\r\n - Hydro-atomic power\r\n - Desalination plant (Salt water to fresh water)\r\n - Non-autonomous fishing building (with rod lending!)\r\n - The Factory\r\n - Farm (where machines tend to plants and people tend to animals)\r\n - Autonomous mine","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
