{"name":"Mid-Pacific Research Laboratory","tagline":"A planned self-sustaining floating research city.","body":"# The Mid-Pacific Research Laboratory\r\n[A researchlaboratory project](http://researchlaboratory.science)\r\n## Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Biology, we've got it all.\r\nThe Mid-Pacific Research Laboratory is a general-purpose research laboratory for just about any subject, from Physics to Biology to Electrical Engineering to Astronomy to *(gasp)* Oceanography.\r\n## We're in the middle of the Pacific.\r\nThere's nothing bothering you here. Every single building has an ocean view.\r\n## Did I mention autonomous?\r\nThere's almost no manual labor in this city. Everything is autonomous, including the Factory.\r\n## That factory... what is it?\r\nIf there's something you need made, create a Factory Definition File (.FDF file) and send it off to the autonomous factory. Within a day, whatever you had made will be sent directly to your room, at no cost.\r\n## Self-sustaining. Really.\r\nWe have many eco-friendly mostly autonomous utility buildings that provide everything a research station in the middle of the ocean needs.\r\n\r\n - Hydro-atomic power\r\n - Desalination plant (Salt water to fresh water)\r\n - Non-autonomous fishing building (with rod lending!)\r\n - The Factory\r\n - Farm (where machines tend to plants and people tend to animals)\r\n - Autonomous mine\r\n\r\n## Price\r\nYou can get this all for the low, low price of **$0**. That's right. Every single perk of this research laboratory for free. Want to build an airplane (or something equally as large)? Free. Want to create a new species? Free. Want to create another [seasteading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasteading \"Wikipedia\") research laboratory? We'll lend you our boats to help. Everything in this laboratory is free, and we have no expenses (as we are self-sustaining).\r\n# Funding\r\nOkay, we'll admit: this isn't a thing. Yet. We are in need of funding to get this lab off the ground. There's not an IndieGoGo or Kickstarter, we're just using good ole' cryptocurrencies and PayPal.\r\n\r\n - Bitcoin: `1NkAXMEK5m3MnTvJsRUdZTgvN8vdYTCh9W`\r\n - Litecoin: `LR92td5bWgQrUNMdYaN8FKfyYA17syXDur`\r\n - <form action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\" target=\"_top\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"cmd\" value=\"_s-xclick\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"hosted_button_id\" value=\"QJMYQ6B4H8BKS\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif\" border=\"0\" name=\"submit\" alt=\"PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"></form>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Contact Us\r\nWant to talk to us about something?
